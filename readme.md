Project: PDF/CSV Chat App Using Langchain and Flask

Description:

In this project, I developed a chat application that allows users to upload PDFs and CSV files and interact with the contents of the documents using large language models (LLMs) through a conversational interface. The application was built using Langchain, an open-source tool written in Python that enables connecting external data to LLMs, and Flask, a micro web framework for Python.

My responsibilities included:

Designing and developing the user interface for uploading documents and interacting with the LLMs
Integrating Langchain wrappers for embedding models, chat models, and vector databases into the application
Implementing natural language processing techniques to enable conversation-style interactions with the uploaded documents
Deploying the application using Flask and ensuring its stability and scalability
Outcomes:

Developed a fully functional PDF/CSV chat app that allows users to interact with the contents of uploaded documents using LLMs
Gained experience in integrating cutting-edge NLP tools and technologies into a real-world application
Demonstrated proficiency in designing and deploying web applications using Flask and other relevant technologies
Skills Used:

Programming languages: Python, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask, Langchain
Technologies: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Large Language Models (LLMs)
Databases: Vector databases
User Interface Design: Conversational interfaces, User Experience (UX) design
